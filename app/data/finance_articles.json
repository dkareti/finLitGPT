Known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS, the primary benefit of a Roth IRA is that your contributions and the earnings on those contributions can grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free after age 59\u00bd, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. In other words, you pay taxes on money going into your Roth IRA, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free."

Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs, with the biggest distinction being how the two are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Unlike a traditional IRA, the contributions are not tax-deductible, but once you start withdrawing funds, the money you take out is tax-free. You can put money you've already paid taxes on into a Roth IRA."

A Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources: All Roth IRA contributions must be made in cash (which includes checks and money orders) unless they are rollover contributions. They can\u2019t be in the form of securities or property."

The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs. These limits apply across all your IRAs, so even if you have multiple accounts you can't contribute more than the maximum. Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested in a Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth IRA is less restrictive than other accounts. The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely."

Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars. You usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement. Once you have contributed money to a Roth IRA, you can put it to work by investing in a variety of securities, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market funds."

Equally bad, if the IRA owner is under age 59\u00bd, an additional 10% early distribution penalty can apply, Slott said. \u201cCrypto makes more sense in a Roth IRA,\" Slott said. \"With Roth IRAs, if the holding rules are followed, any earnings can be distributed tax-free.

You would need to claim $5,000 on your tax returns in 2020 and 2021. If you repaid the funds in full in 2022, then you would not have needed to pay taxes on the final $5,000."

Whether a Roth IRA is more beneficial than a traditional IRA depends on the tax bracket of the filer, the expected tax rate at retirement, and personal preference. Individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket once they retire may find the Roth IRA more advantageous since the total tax avoided in retirement will be greater than the income tax paid in the present."

Traditional IRA beneficiaries, on the other hand, do pay taxes on the distributions."

For individuals who anticipate that they will be in a higher tax bracket when they are older or have retired, Roth IRAs can provide a beneficial option, as the money is not taxable if you\u2019ve met the time requirements, unlike withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA. Roth IRA benefits are powerful."

Typically, investment offerings include stock and bond mutual funds and target-date funds designed to reduce the risk of losses as the employee approaches retirement.

One of the big advantages of a traditional 401(k) plan is that it lets you reduce your tax burden while saving for retirement. With a Roth 401(k), qualifying withdrawals are tax free."

What\u2019s more, your employer might provide a match, boosting your retirement savings. However, a 401(k) can come with fees\u2014though they\u2019re typically modest. Traditional (not Roth) accounts are subject to RMDs. There are penalties for withdrawing funds early\u2014if you\u2019re younger than 59\u00bd and you don\u2019t qualify for a hardship withdrawal, you\u2019ll need to pay a 10% penalty to the IRS."

Consider talking to a financial professional who can walk you through other options. The United States has undergone a significant shift in how Americans save for retirement, as illustrated below by our chart comparing the number of Americans (in millions) in defined benefit and defined contribution plans, along with the total for both. Defined contribution plans, most of which are 401(k)s, are an alternative to the traditional pension, known as a defined benefit plan."

In recent decades, as the chart below shows, defined contribution plans like 401(k)s have become far more common, and traditional pensions have become rare as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to employees.

    "content": "Initially offered by employers to supplement other employee benefits, 401(k)s have become the most common private employer-sponsored retirement program in the U.S. About a third of working-age Americans have a 401(k), compared with one in nine who have a defined benefit pension plan. Meanwhile, U.S. Census data suggests that as many as four in 10 baby boomers and half of millennials have no retirement account at all. Still, the 401(k) plan was designed to encourage Americans to save for retirement. Among its benefits are tax savings. There are two main options, traditional and Roth, each with distinct tax advantages."

    "content": "If your employer offers both types of 401(k) plans, you can split your contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a Roth 401(k). Both brokerage and 401(k) accounts are investment accounts, but they serve different purposes. A 401(k) is primarily for retirement savings, while a brokerage account can be used for various financial goals and often offers more control over the investments. A 401(k) is a type of qualified retirement plan. Within it, you can choose from a menu of investment options (generally mutual funds) where your money grows in a tax-advantaged manner."

    "content": "A brokerage account, meanwhile, is a private account where you can buy, sell, and hold whatever securities your broker has access to, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Brokerage accounts are taxable, meaning that your capital gains and dividends are subject to tax in the current period. There are also no contribution limits, early withdrawal considerations, or minimum distributions. When you leave a company where you\u2019ve been employed and you have a 401(k) plan, you generally have four options: Withdrawing the money is usually a bad idea unless you urgently need it."

You will be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless you are 59\u00bd or older, permanently disabled, or meet the other IRS criteria for an exemption from the rule. For a Roth 401(k), you can withdraw your contributions (but not any earnings) tax free and without penalty if you have had the account for at least five years or meet the IRS criteria mentioned previously. However, you\u2019re still decreasing your retirement savings, which you may regret later."

What\u2019s more, you can choose from among a wider range of investment choices than you had with your employer\u2019s plan. The IRS has relatively strict rules on rollovers and how they need to be accomplished. Not following them is costly. Typically, the financial institution in line to receive the money will help with the process to prevent any missteps."

This generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000. For smaller accounts, an employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere. Leaving the money where it is makes sense if the former employer\u2019s plan is well-managed and you are satisfied with its investment choices."

Their heirs might also be unaware of the existence of the accounts. Capitalize, an investment platform specializing in rolling over forgotten or left-behind 401(k) accounts, estimates that in 2023, there were almost 30 million such accounts in the U.S., holding about a quarter of Americans\u2019 total assets in 401(k) plans.

If you aren\u2019t comfortable with managing a rollover, you can leave some of the work to the new plan\u2019s administrator. A 401(k) plan is a workplace retirement plan that allows you to make annual contributions up to a specific limit and invest that money for your later years after your working days are over. There are two major types of 401(k) plans: traditional or Roth."

    "content": "The traditional 401(k) involves pretax contributions that give you a tax break when you make them and reduce your taxable income. However, you pay ordinary income tax on your withdrawals. The Roth 401(k) involves after-tax contributions and no upfront tax break, but you won\u2019t pay taxes on your withdrawals in retirement. Both accounts allow employer contributions that can increase your savings.
